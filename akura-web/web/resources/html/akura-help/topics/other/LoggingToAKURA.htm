<h1>Logging in to Akura</h1>
<span class="nav">Navigation: Login page</span>
<p>You can log in to the Akura school management system by
entering the user name and the password emailed to you by the system
administrator. If you are logging in to Akura for the first time, you
have to change the default password that was emailed to you by the
administrator. During the initial login, you will be prompted to set
security questions as well. If you have forgotten your user name or
password, you can retrieve them through the log in page.</p><p><span class="note">Note:
You are allowed four attempts to enter the correct username and
password. Following the fourth unsuccessful login attempt, your account
will be locked. Since your account will be locked after a fourth
unsuccessful attempt to log in, resetting your password is recommended
before making the fifth attempt. Once your account is locked, you will
need to contact the administrator to have it </span><span class="note">unlocked.</span></p>
